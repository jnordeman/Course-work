# GARCH

This folder inlcudes code to: 
  - Visualise time series data using `ggplot2`
  - Apply ARCH and GARCH models to stock data 

In attempt to keep the code tidy, the folder has separate scripts for: 

  1. [Data retrival](Set-up.R)
  2. [Data visualisation](Visualisation.R)
  3. [Estimation and forecasting the volatility of stock return](Estimation.R)

Note that the [set-up](Set-up.R) includes data retrieval, a common theme, and the libraries required for both [data visualisation](Visualisation.R) and [estimation](Estimation.R).
