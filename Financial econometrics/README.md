# GARCH

This folder inlcudes code to: 
  - Visualise time series data using `ggplot2`
  - Apply ARCH and GARCH models to stock data 

In attempt to keep the code tidy, the folder has separate scripts to: 

  1. [Retrieve the data](GARCH/Set-up.R)
  2. [Visualise the data](GARCH/Visualisation.R)
  3. [Estimating and forecasting the volatility of stock return](GARCH/Estimation.R)
