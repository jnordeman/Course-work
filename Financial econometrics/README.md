# GARCH

This folder inlcudes code to: 
  - Visualise time series data using `ggplot2`
  - Apply ARCH and GARCH models to stock data 

In attempt to keep the code tidy, the folder has separate scripts for: 

  1. [Data retrival](GARCH/Set-up.R)
  2. [Data visualisation](GARCH/Visualisation.R)
  3. [Estimation and forecasting the volatility of stock return](GARCH/Estimation.R)
