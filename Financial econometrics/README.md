# GARCH

This folder inlcudes code to: 
  - Visualise time series data using `ggplot2`
  - Apply ARCH and GARCH models to stock data 

In attempt to keep the code tidy, the folder has separate scripts to: 

  1. Retrieve the data
  2. Visualise the data 
  3. Estimating and forecasting the volatility of stock return
